# SYSADM1 -- Creating and Modifying an SOP for User Account Creation

# Instructions:  {#instructions .list-paragraph}

1.  Create a standardized Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for user
    account creation within your organization\'s IT infrastructure.
    Follow the SOP outline provided below.

2.  Ensure consistency, efficiency, and security in the user account
    creation process.

3.  Practice the process of modifying an SOP to accommodate changes in
    requirements or procedures.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
A.  **Standard Operating System for User Account Creation**

**Purpose:** Briefly state the objective of the SOP

**Scope:** Define the boundaries of the procedure (which systems or
departments it applies to)

**Procedure:** Provide step-by-step instructions for creating a user
account including:

-   Gathering required information

-   Verifying user identity

-   Assigning appropriate roles and permissions

-   Providing initial password guidelines

-   Notifying the user of account creation

> **Review and Approval**: Outline the process for reviewing and
> approving the created user account.
>
> **Exceptions:** Address any exceptions or special cases that might
> arise during the account creation process.

B.  **Scenario-Based Modification**

> **Scenario:** The organization decides to implement a new multi-factor
> authentication (MFA) requirement for all user accounts.
>
> **Task:** Modify the existing SOP to incorporate the MFA requirement,
> ensuring that the updated procedure remains clear, concise, and
> effective. Write your modification/s in the addendum portion.

**Purpose:**\
To establish a standardized process for creating user accounts in the
organization\'s IT infrastructure, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and
security.

**Scope:**\
This SOP applies to all IT-managed systems, including internal
applications, email platforms, and cloud-based services, for all
departments within the organization.

### **Procedure**

1.  

> **Gather Required Information:**

2.  1.  Collect the user\'s full name, job title, department, employee
        > ID, contact details, and manager\'s approval.

    2.  Ensure accuracy of the information provided.

3.  

> **Verify User Identity:**

4.  1.  Cross-check the user\'s identity with their government-issued ID
        > or official employee badge.

    2.  Verify employment status with the HR database.

5.  

> **Assign Appropriate Roles and Permissions:**

6.  1.  Identify the user\'s role and required access level based on
        > their job description.

    2.  Apply the principle of least privilege to grant only necessary
        > access rights.

7.  

> **Provide Initial Password Guidelines:**

8.  1.  Generate a strong temporary password (e.g., at least 12
        > characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special
        > characters).

    2.  Ensure the password is shared securely (e.g., via encrypted
        > email).

9.  

> **Notify the User of Account Creation:**

10. 1.  Send an email confirmation to the user with their username,
        > temporary password, and login instructions.

    2.  Include a request to update their password on the first login.

11. 

> **Review and Approval:**

12. 1.  Submit the account creation details to the IT manager for final
        > review and approval.

    2.  Ensure documentation is complete for auditing purposes.

**Exceptions:**

-   Temporary accounts for contractors or interns must include an
    > expiration date.

-   For shared or group accounts, ensure a responsible owner is
    > designated.

### **Addendum: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Requirement**

**Scenario:** The organization implements a mandatory MFA requirement
for all user accounts.

**Modification:**

1.  

> **Update Step 4 - Provide Initial Password Guidelines:**

2.  -   Include instructions for enabling MFA on the user\'s account
        > during the first login process.

3.  

> **New Step: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication Setup:**

4.  -   After account creation, guide the user to configure MFA (e.g.,
        > through an authentication app or SMS-based verification).

    -   Provide clear instructions on setting up MFA during the first
        > login attempt.

5.  

> **Notify User:**

6.  -   Inform the user that MFA is mandatory and provide
        > troubleshooting support contacts for any issues.

7.  

> **Review and Approval:**

8.  -   Verify that MFA is successfully enabled before granting full
        > access to systems.

This updated SOP ensures compliance with the new MFA policy while
maintaining clarity and security in the user account creation process.

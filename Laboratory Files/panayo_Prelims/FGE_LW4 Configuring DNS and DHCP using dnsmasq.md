# SYSADM1 -- Configuring DNS and DHCP with dnsmasq

# Requirement: 

-   A virtual machine running Linux

    Tasks:

    1.  Install dnsmasq

        ![](vertopal_e42cbf2a6f1141ac95e69c229b22ea87/media/image2.png){width="2.46875in"
        height="0.84375in"}

    2.  Create a configuration file dns.conf

    3.  Add the following lines to the configuration file:

        interface=eth0 \# Replace with your network interface

        dhcp-range=192.168.1.100,192.168.1.200,24h

        domain=example.com \# Replace with your desired domain

        server=8.8.8.8 \# Specify a DNS resolver

    4.  Adjust the interface, dhcp-range, and domain values as needed
        > for your network.

    5.  Start dnsmasq

        height="0.9166666666666666in"}

    6.  Connect a new device to the network and verify that it receives
        > and IP address from the DHCP scope

    7.  Configure a client devices to use the dnsmasq server as its DNS
        > resolver

    8.  Test connectivity by executing a two-way ping

    9.  Write a reflection about how Linux and Windows differ in terms
        > of setting DNS and DHCP.
